DESCRIPTION:\n				<p>Arquillian is an innovative and highly extensible te
 sting platform that enables developers to easily create automated integr
 ation\, functional\, and acceptance tests for Java middleware. It runs t
 ests directly in the container and can simplify application testing. Lib
 erty is a lightweight\, dynamically configurable\, profile of IBM WebSph
 ere Application Server. Applications written using Liberty are compatibl
 e with the full IBM WebSphere Application Server programming model for W
 eb\, OSGi\, and Enterprise JavaBeans applications. Come and learn how to
  use Arquillian and the Liberty runtime to bring real tests to IBM WebSp
 here applications.</p>\n

DESCRIPTION:\n				<p>It feels like we have building web sites and applica
 tions for centuries\, doesn’t it? However\, we know that this is so untr
 ue\, because the web is only 25 years old since Sir Tim Berner’s Lee gre
 at proposal at CERN. The impetus of online design and development has ch
 anged\, we now talk about the Digital Worker\, the Digital environment a
 nd we about building web applications and ecommerce applications that ar
 e user friendly and customer centric. So what has this all to with the h
 umble Java application developer? The answer is everything. We must be e
 xplicit in the software that we write\, lean and agile in the way we wri
 te\, and whilst making sure the take full advantage of the underlying Ja
 va platform. In fact\, because we have this magnificent Java Virtual Mac
 hine and open standards like Java EE\, we can continue build quality\, r
 obust and sustainable software for all our stakeholders and business use
 rs.</p>\n<ul class="bullets">\n  <li>Introduction to Java EE 7 (brief)</

DESCRIPTION:\n				<p>Google App Engine (GAE) is a popular PaaS offering. 
 While its scalable and reliable environment is hidden behind custom API\
 , this makes GAE apps hard to port over to other non-GAE environments. W
 hat if one could implement such similar environment? And you could simpl
 y move your GAE application’s .war file to this new environment and it w
 ould just work? But the question we need to ask ourselves first\, how do
  we know that such alternative environment works in the first place? Jav
 a EE has had its Technology Compatibility Kit (TCK) from day one. This t
 ime we’ll introduce you to GAE TCK and show you how to run it against an
  alternative JBoss CapeDwarf GAE API implementation. The GAE TCK is buil
 t completely on open source software\, and it is a collaboration between
  Red Hat and Google on making the GAE API and its implementations better
 . The goal is not just to run the tests\, but also engage users and deve
 lopers with a bunch of exciting extensions that range from cool html rep
 orting to bytecode manipulation of external tests. If you care about GAE
 \, testing\, Arquillian\, ShrinkWrap\, this is the session not to miss!<

DESCRIPTION:\n				<p>Data storage is one of the most crucial parts of any
  applications\, and we use many different tools and tricks to keep it in
  a good shape. We frequently use both old school relational systems with
  new approaches commonly known as NoSQL. We write sophisticated queries 
 and use optimization techniques to give our end users the greatest possi
 ble experience.</p>\n<p>So why is persistence very often skipped in the 
 testing efforts? Is it really that complex and painful to setup? During 
 this talk we will have a closer look at Arquillian Persistence Extension
  together with NoSQLUnit. These tools remove that burden and boilerplate
  to make you a happy and productive programmer again! Join this session 
 and see for yourself that writing tests for your data storage logic is a
 s easy as writing normal unit tests!</p>\n

DESCRIPTION:\n				<p>How do you test your Android applications\, both web
  and Android ones\, in a functional way? Not yet? Big mistake! With the 
 existence of Graphene and Droidium tooling from Arquillian universe\, yo
 u are able to test them very conveniently. First part of the talk will g
 ive you brief introduction to Arquillian Graphene while in the second pa
 rt\, you will get know Arquillian Droidium. Droidium is new tool from Ar
 quillian platform which enables you to use Graphene Selenium-like API fo
 r web and native Android applications. We will show you its main feature
 s\, how to use it and how to write tests in a Graphene way and how to us
 e Java EE application containers in connection with Android devices in o
 ne test run which interacts together.</p>\n

DESCRIPTION:\n				<p>Apache TomEE is the Java EE Web Profile certified ve
 rsion of Apache Tomcat and combines the simplicity of Tomcat with the po
 wer of Java EE. The first half of this session introduces TomEE and show
 s how Tomcat applications leveraging Java EE technologies can become sim
 pler and lighter with a Java EE certified solution built right on Tomcat
 .<br>\nThe second half jumps right into action and gives a coding tour o
 f TomEE\, including quickly bootstrapping projects\, doing proper testin
 g with Arquillian\, and setting up environments. If you're a Tomcat love
 r or a TomEE enthusiast\, this is the session you don't want to miss!</p
