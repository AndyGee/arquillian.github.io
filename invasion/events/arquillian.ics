DESCRIPTION:\n				<p>The Borg is docking your system\; testing is futile!
  Or is it? With microservices\, polyglot\, and DevOps on the rise\, wher
 e are we at with testing?</p>\n<p>Do these technologies bring more compl
 exity and make our testing effort harder\, or maybe the contrary? Do the
 y actually help us write better tests more easily?</p>\n<p>This session 
 explores not only how we can do our testing in this new world but also h
 ow the new world can help us test better.</p>\n<p>It takes a close look 
 at various topics\, from NodeJS\, DynJS\, VertX\, Ceylon or Ruby\, orche
 strated microservices\, system scale testing with various configurations
  to database migration and regression testing.All are within reach.</p>\
