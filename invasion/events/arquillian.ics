DESCRIPTION:\n				<p>There’s no better way to communicate about the sof
 tware you’re developing—no way that’s more real\, meaningful and m
 easurable—than by using tests\, real tests. Tests tell a story about h
 ow the software is expected to behave and the purpose it serves. They al
 so demonstrate the software does what it is expected to do. If either ha
 lf of the equation is broken\, you have something tangible to fix and a 
 basis for a conversation about it.</p>\n<p>In this session\, we’ll exp
 lore agile development tools that help create real tests that show real 
 results and collect real feedback. We’ll explore the concepts of Behav
 ior-Driven Development (BDD) and Acceptance Test-Driven Development (ATD
 D) through the use of tools from the Arquillian Universe such as Arquill
 ian Drone\, Selenium\, Thucydides and Spock to demonstrate how to use re
 al tests to drive development.</p>\n<p>Testing features and behaviors ha
 s never been so clear and so real! What you’ll take away is a medium t
 hrough which to communicate with stakeholders about the software in whic
 h you’re both investing.</p>\n
