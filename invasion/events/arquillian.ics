DESCRIPTION:\n				<p>For years Red Hat has been exploring how to layer an
 d separate its code to test it in isolation on the unit level. It has ke
 pt integration and functional testing as a big ball of mud\, jumping str
 aight from unit to full system testing. But could it apply some of the s
 ame lessons learned from unit testing to integration testing? This sessi
 on explores the different technologies within the enterprise Java specif
 ication and shows how Red Hat’s application could be tested in isolati
 on\; layer for layer\, module for module\, and component for component. 
 Is it possible to isolate and stay real at the same time? Do mocks\, stu
 bs\, and test doubles have a place in the world of integration testing? 
 Are there other lessons to be learned?</p>\n<p>Hilton - Continental Ball

DESCRIPTION:\n				<p>This technical session introduces Java developers\, 
 designers\, and architects to the Arquillian framework\, Gradle\, and th
 e enterprise container technologies in Java EE 7. As a lucrative bonus\,
  it covers building EJB and Java EE 7 test applications with Gradle\, th
 e latest and greatest build framework for the Java platform\, which impr
 oves on Apache Maven. The Java EE specification contains two and half di
 fferent containers\, namely the Web\, EJB\, and the CDI containers. All 
 of them can be reached with the Arquillian framework\, and this means th
 at there is now one general testing framework. The session covers writin
 g meaningful tests for CDI\, EJB\, HTML5 WebSocket\, and JAX-RS 2.0 in t
 he real world.</p>\n<p>Parc 55 - Mission</p>\n

DESCRIPTION:\n				<p>JBoss Arquillian is currently the most popular frame
 work connected with testing of Java EE applications. Its modularity allo
 wed for creation of many extensions connected with e.g. testing of persi
 stence\, ui and rest services.</p>\n<p>Aquillian is not limited to Java 
 EE only. During presentation Michał will present an intruduction to Arq
 uillian universe\, describing the most interesting modules and extension
 s and supported platforms.</p>\n

DESCRIPTION:\n				<p>Everybody is unit testing\, everybody is mocking. Ev
 erybody mocks database access\, software dependencies\, external systems
 \, container services\, ... to test what? You end up testing a bit of bu
 siness logic and writing a lot of test code\, when in production this co
 de will run within a container under different circumstances. In this ta
 lk we are going to see how some tools like Arquillian\, Byteman\, NoSQLU
 nit and other programs\, may help us writing real tests in a Java EE env
 ironment.</p>\n
