DESCRIPTION:\n				<p>For years we've been exploring how to layer and sepa
 rate our code to<br>\ntest in isolation on the unit level. We've kept in
 tegration and<br>\nfunctional testing as a big ball of mud\; jumping str
 aight from unit to<br>\nfull system testing. But can we apply some of th
 e same lessons learned<br>\nfrom unit to integration testing?</p>\n<p>Th
 is session explore the different technologies within the Java<br>\nEnter
 prise specification and see how our application can be tested in<br>\nis
 olation\; layer for layer\, module for module and component for<br>\ncom
 ponent.</p>\n<p>Can we isolate and stay real at the same time? Does mock
 s\, stubs and<br>\ntest doubles have a place in the world of integration
  testing? Are<br>\nthere other lessons to be learned?</p>\n
