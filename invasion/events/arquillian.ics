DESCRIPTION:\n				<p>Everybody is unit testing\, everybody is mocking. Ev
 erybody mocks database access\, software dependencies\, external systems
 \, container services\, ... to test what? You end up testing a bit of bu
 siness logic and writing a lot of test code\, when in production this co
 de will run within a container under different circumstances. In this ta
 lk we are going to see how some tools like Arquillian\, Byteman\, NoSQLU
 nit and other programs\, may help us writing real tests in a Java EE env
 ironment.</p>\n
