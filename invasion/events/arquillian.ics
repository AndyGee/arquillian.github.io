DESCRIPTION:\n				<p>Part 2 of last year’s Rock Star session “Today
 ’s Rapid Java EE Development: Live Coding from Scratch to Deployment\,
 ” this session pulls a variety of examples in testable development fro
 m O’Reilly's Continuous Enterprise Development in Java\, including a r
 eview of the sections on<br>\n• RESTful services<br>\n•UI verificati
 on<br>\n•Transactions<br>\n•Security</p>\n<p>...and covers other are
 as of the Java EE platform that have historically been branded as “dif
 ficult to test.” The session spends a lot of time in the IDE\, with ex
 amples that are freely available to fork and run.</p>\n<p>Parc 55 - Miss

DESCRIPTION:\n				<p>For years Red Hat has been exploring how to layer an
 d separate its code to test it in isolation on the unit level. It has ke
 pt integration and functional testing as a big ball of mud\, jumping str
 aight from unit to full system testing. But could it apply some of the s
 ame lessons learned from unit testing to integration testing? This sessi
 on explores the different technologies within the enterprise Java specif
 ication and shows how Red Hat’s application could be tested in isolati
 on\; layer for layer\, module for module\, and component for component. 
 Is it possible to isolate and stay real at the same time? Do mocks\, stu
 bs\, and test doubles have a place in the world of integration testing? 
 Are there other lessons to be learned?</p>\n<p>Hilton - Continental Ball
