DESCRIPTION:\n				<p>The JBoss Way is a better way to build applications\
 , using modern technologies\, with a recommended approach that makes you
  more productive. We’ve assembled and integrated some of the best projec
 ts available so developers can focus on building their applications easi
 ly.</p>\n<p>The JBoss Way provides some exceptional tooling\, including 
 Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio\, JBoss Forge\, and Arquillian to increas
 e productivity. There are a variety of choices and innovations available
  that all build upon the foundations of Java EE 6 and CDI. Whether you d
 eploy your applications locally or to the cloud\, you’ll be using one of
  the best application servers available. Building applications was never
  this fun. Follow along the JBoss Way.</p>\n

DESCRIPTION:\n				<p>For years we’ve been exploring how to layer and sepa
 rate our code to test in isolation on the unit level. We’ve kept integra
 tion and functional testing as a big ball of mud\; jumping straight from
  unit to full system testing. But can we apply some of the same lessons 
 learned from unit to integration testing?</p>\n<p>This session explore t
 he different technologies within the Java Enterprise specification and s
 ee how our application can be tested in isolation\; layer for layer\, mo
 dule for module and component for component.</p>\n<p>Can we isolate and 
 stay real at the same time? Does mocks\, stubs and test doubles have a p
 lace in the world of integration testing? Are there other lessons to be 
 learned?</p>\n

DESCRIPTION:\n				<p>Everybody is mocking in unit test. To test what? You
 r code will be run within a Java EE container. Let's start writing fast 
 real tests.</p>\n<p>Are you confident enough to push your application to
  production without fear? Will it run correctly with all components? Kee
 p the fail whale at bay? Confidence comes from writing real tests.</p>\n
 <p>In this workshop we are going to see how some tools like Arquillian\,
  Byteman\, NoSQLUnit or Moco and other programs\, may help us writing re
 al tests in situations where you typically would use mocks.</p>\n<p>Come
  to this workshop and learn how to write faster and more effectively tes
 ts.</p>\n<p>* Resistance is futile mocks will be assimilated<br>\n** Som

DESCRIPTION:\n				<p>Arquillian is an innovative and highly extensible te
 sting platform that enables developers to easily create automated integr
 ation\, functional\, and acceptance tests for Java middleware. It runs t
 ests directly in the container and can simplify application testing. Lib
 erty is a lightweight\, dynamically configurable\, profile of IBM WebSph
 ere Application Server. Applications written using Liberty are compatibl
 e with the full IBM WebSphere Application Server programming model for W
 eb\, OSGi\, and Enterprise JavaBeans applications. Come and learn how to
  use Arquillian and the Liberty runtime to bring real tests to IBM WebSp
 here applications.</p>\n

DESCRIPTION:\n				<p>Data storage is one of the most crucial parts of any
  applications\, and we use many different tools and tricks to keep it in
  a good shape. We frequently use both old school relational systems with
  new approaches commonly known as NoSQL. We write sophisticated queries 
 and use optimization techniques to give our end users the greatest possi
 ble experience.</p>\n<p>So why is persistence very often skipped in the 
 testing efforts? Is it really that complex and painful to setup? During 
 this talk we will have a closer look at Arquillian Persistence Extension
  together with NoSQLUnit. These tools remove that burden and boilerplate
  to make you a happy and productive programmer again! Join this session 
 and see for yourself that writing tests for your data storage logic is a
 s easy as writing normal unit tests!</p>\n

DESCRIPTION:\n				<p>Apache TomEE is the Java EE Web Profile certified ve
 rsion of Apache Tomcat and combines the simplicity of Tomcat with the po
 wer of Java EE. The first half of this session introduces TomEE and show
 s how Tomcat applications leveraging Java EE technologies can become sim
 pler and lighter with a Java EE certified solution built right on Tomcat
 .<br>\nThe second half jumps right into action and gives a coding tour o
 f TomEE\, including quickly bootstrapping projects\, doing proper testin
 g with Arquillian\, and setting up environments. If you're a Tomcat love
 r or a TomEE enthusiast\, this is the session you don't want to miss!</p
