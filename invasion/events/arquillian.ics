DESCRIPTION:\n				<p>Arquillian is an innovative and highly extensible te
 sting <br>\nplatform for the JVM that enables developers to easily creat
 e automated <br>\nintegration\, functional and acceptance tests for Java
  middleware\, from <br>\nJava EE and beyond.</p>\n<p>In this presentatio
 n\, we'll focus on the "highly <br>\nextensible" part\, one of Arquillia
 n's proven strengths. Arquillian was <br>\ndesigned with the ability to 
 change its default behavior via its <br>\npowerful extension model. Thes
 e extensions are portals through which <br>\nArquillian can travel to ta
 ke on challenges in new domains or those yet <br>\nto be realized.</p>\n

DESCRIPTION:\n				<p>For years we’ve been exploring how to layer and sepa
 rate our <br>\ncode to test in isolation on the unit level. We’ve kept i
 ntegration and <br>\nfunctional testing as a big ball of mud\; jumping s
 traight from unit to <br>\nfull system testing. But can we apply some of
  the same lessons learned <br>\nfrom unit to integration testing?</p>\n<
 p>This session explore the different technologies <br>\nwithin the Java 
 Enterprise specification and see how our application can<br>\nbe tested 
 in isolation\; layer for layer\, module for module and <br>\ncomponent f
 or component.</p>\n<p>Can we isolate and stay real at the same time? Doe
 s <br>\nmocks\, stubs and test doubles have a place in the world of inte
 gration <br>\ntesting? Are there other lessons to be learned?</p>\n

DESCRIPTION:\n				<p>The JBoss Way is a better way to build applications\
 , using modern technologies\, with a recommended approach that makes you
  more productive. We’ve assembled and integrated some of the best projec
 ts available so developers can focus on building their applications easi
 ly.</p>\n<p>The JBoss Way provides some exceptional tooling\, including 
 Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio\, JBoss Forge\, and Arquillian to increas
 e productivity. There are a variety of choices and innovations available
  that all build upon the foundations of Java EE 6 and CDI. Whether you d
 eploy your applications locally or to the cloud\, you’ll be using one of
  the best application servers available. Building applications was never
  this fun. Follow along the JBoss Way.</p>\n

DESCRIPTION:\n				<p>Data storage is one of the most crucial parts of any
  applications\, and we use many different tools and tricks to keep it in
  a good shape. We frequently use both old school relational systems with
  new approaches commonly known as NoSQL. We write sophisticated queries 
 and use optimization techniques to give our end users the greatest possi
 ble experience.</p>\n<p>So why is persistence very often skipped in the 
 testing efforts? Is it really that complex and painful to setup? During 
 this talk we will have a closer look at Arquillian Persistence Extension
  together with NoSQLUnit. These tools remove that burden and boilerplate
  to make you a happy and productive programmer again! Join this session 
 and see for yourself that writing tests for your data storage logic is a
 s easy as writing normal unit tests!</p>\n
