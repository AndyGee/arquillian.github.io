DESCRIPTION:\n				<p>Writing unit tests for Java EE applications often re
 quires endless mocking of container features.<br>\nHave you ever wondere
 d if thereâ€™s a better way?<br>\nJBoss Arquillian is open source softwa
 re that empowers you to test JVM-based applications more<br>\neffectivel
 y. Created to defend the software galaxy from bugs\, Arquillian brings y
 our tests to the<br>\nruntime\, so you can focus on testing your applica
 tion's code\, rather than trying to replicate the<br>\nruntime behaviour
 .<br>\nUsing Arquillian\, you can develop a comprehensive suite of tests
  from the convenience of your<br>\nIDE and run them in any IDE\, build t
 ool or continuous integration environment.<br>\nJBoss Arquillian provide
 s a framework for writing unit tests that are packaged\, deployed and<br
 >\nexecuted directly in the destination container of choice\, running th
 e actual code instead of mock<br>\nclasses.</p>\n
