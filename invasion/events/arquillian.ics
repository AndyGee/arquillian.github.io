DESCRIPTION:\n				<p>Nowadays a lot of applications are being developed n
 ot using a single language but more than one. <br>\nOne of the most used
  paradigm is implementing the front-end using Html + JavaScript (for exa
 mple with AngularJs) and implementing the back-end with Java.</p>\n<p>Th
 ere is a lot of test frameworks for Javascipt code and the same for Java
 \, but if you want to test system wide in an automatic way it seems that
  you need some kind of glue to meet both worlds.</p>\n<p>Come to this se
 ssion to learn how Arquillian can help you on writing tests for these ap
 plications.</p>\n

DESCRIPTION:\n				<p>With microservices\, polyglot\, and DevOps on the ri
 se\, what's happening with testing? Do they increase complexity and make
  our testing efforts harder? Or do they actually make it easier to write
  better tests?</p>\n<p>In this session\, we will explore how we can do o
 ur testing in this new world\, and how the new world can help us test be
 tter.</p>\n<p>Other topics we'll discuss include:</p>\n<ul class="bullet
 s">\n  <li>NodeJS\, DynJS\, VertX\, Ceylon\, or Ruby-orchestrated micros
 ervices.</li>\n  <li>System scale testing with different configurations.
 </li>\n  <li>Database migration and regression testing.</li>\n</ul>\n

DESCRIPTION:\n				<p>Writing integration tests is traditionally a painful
  step in the development process. Kubernetes provides new a means of wir
 ing services together with the goal of simplifying integration testing. 
 But it comes with its own set of challenges.</p>\n<p>In this lab\, weâ€™ll
  take a closer look at some of those challenges and learn how to use the
  project Arquillian to write integration tests for Kubernetes-based proj
 ects.</p>\n
