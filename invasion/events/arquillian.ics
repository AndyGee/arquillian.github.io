DESCRIPTION:\n				<p>Everybody is unit testing\, everybody is mocking. Ev
 erybody mocks database access\, software dependencies\, external systems
 \, container services\, ... to test what? You end up testing a bit of bu
 siness logic and writing a lot of test code\, when in production this co
 de will run within a container under different circumstances. In this ta
 lk we are going to see how some tools like Arquillian\, Byteman\, NoSQLU
 nit and other programs\, may help us writing real tests in a Java EE env
 ironment.</p>\n

DESCRIPTION:\n				<p>This session is a Lab : Don’t forget your laptop</
 p>\n<p>Unit testing is one of the key techniques helping developers to d
 eliver high quality software. But relying only on it is most of the time
 s just an illusion of safety. Eventually we need to verify how our compo
 nents are interacting or whether running in the target environment does 
 not end up with some unexpected behaviour. Last but not least it all amo
 unts to whether your application is providing the end user with what he 
 or she is really expecting. Arquillian is an innovative and highly exten
 sible testing platform for the JVM that enables developers to easily cre
 ate automated integration\, functional and acceptance tests for Java mid
 dleware.</p>\n<p>Requirements</p>\n<p>Our lab is targeted for intermedia
 te and advanced Java developers. If you want to participate\, you should
  be comfortable with key Java EE 6 concepts such as CDI\, EJBs\, JPA and
  with automated testing concepts. And it’s even better if you know how
  Selenium works !</p>\n
