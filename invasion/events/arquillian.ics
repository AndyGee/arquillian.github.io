DESCRIPTION:\n				<p>Arquillian driven testing is fast becoming a de-fact
 o standard for testing JavaEE applications. It builds upon the solid and
  well established foundation of JUnit or TestNG by pulling in the "Produ
 ction Near" runtime of your chosen application server. The advantages of
  this should be clear - It is like letting your test case out of the box
 \, but without the risk of pulling your actual production environment do
 wn.The goals of Arquillian are very clear:</p>\n<ul class="bullets">\n  
 <li>Tests should be portable to any supported container.</li>\n  <li>Tes
 ts should be executable from both the IDE and the build tool.</li>\n  <l
 i>The platform should extend or integrate existing test frameworks.</li>
 \n</ul>\n<p>This all comes with "out of the box" support for in-test CDI
 \, which will greatly enhance your testing scenarios. A huge collection 
 of plugin modules are available to further extend virtually every aspect
  of JavaEE testing. One of the latest features to hit the ground running
  is "Arquillian Cube" - An Arquillian extension that can be used to mana
 ge Docker containers directly from Arquillian. Get more closer to the pr
 oduction environment than ever before! This talk will take the Arquillia
 n beginner from the very basic first steps of production near testing us
 ing Arquillian\, CDI and Apache TomEE and enable them to join the advanc
 ed user on the path to using Arquillian Cube.</p>\n
