DESCRIPTION:\n				<p>For years developers have been exploring how to laye
 r and separate code to test it in isolation on the unit level. It has ke
 pt integration and functional testing as a big ball of mud\, jumping str
 aight from unit to full system testing. But could some of the same lesso
 ns learned from unit testing apply to integration testing? Is it possibl
 e to isolate and stay real at the same time? Do mocks\, stubs\, and test
  doubles have a place in the world of integration testing? Are there oth
 er lessons to be learned? This session explores the different technologi
 es within the enterprise Java specification and shows how enterprise Jav
 a applications can be tested in isolation - layer for layer\, module for
  module\, and component for component.</p>\n

DESCRIPTION:\n				<p>Arquillian is an innovative and highly extensible te
 sting <br>\nplatform for the JVM that enables developers to easily creat
 e automated <br>\nintegration\, functional and acceptance tests for Java
  middleware\, from <br>\nJava EE and beyond.</p>\n<p>In this presentatio
 n\, we'll focus on the "highly <br>\nextensible" part\, one of Arquillia
 n's proven strengths. Arquillian was <br>\ndesigned with the ability to 
 change its default behavior via its <br>\npowerful extension model. Thes
 e extensions are portals through which <br>\nArquillian can travel to ta
 ke on challenges in new domains or those yet <br>\nto be realized.</p>\n
